Wednesday<br>

My parents are always saying the world doesn's revole around me,but sometimes <br>
I wonder if it actually DOSE.</p>

<br>
<p>
When I was little kid,I saw this movie about a man whose whole life is secret bring filmed<br>
for a TV show. This guy is famous all over the world, and he doesn't KNOW it.
</p>

<p>
Well ever since I saw that movie, I've kind of figured the same thing is probably happening to ME.
</p>

<p>
At first I was annoyed my life was being broadcasted without my permission.<br>
But then I realized if millions of people are tuning in everyday to see what I'm up to,<br>
that's actually kinda COOl.
